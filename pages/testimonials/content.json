      "quote": "\"We don't even know where to start with praising Freya! She is AMAZING!\n\nWe were quite specific with our stationery theme - 'Turkish, Winter, Christmas but not too Christmas and still Wedding' and how Freya managed to pull all of this together, we will never know! From the Save the Dates to the beautiful frame made for my sister to give us a wedding gift to remember our day, and everything in between was beyond beautiful. \n\nAll of the little details in the stationery did not go unnoticed and even on the day we kept getting so many comments from our guests saying how gorgeous it all was and how it tied in so perfectly with the venue and feel of our wedding.\n\nEverything was so beautiful, classy, elegant and festive! Nothing was too much trouble, everything we asked for we got, and got better than we imagined. Not only is Freya amazing at her job, she is fun, friendly and yet professional. Her attitude to your work and business is marvellous. \n\nThis stationery is one of a kind, and everything that is produced is different from the next and different to anything else we have ever seen! THANK YOU!!\"",

      "quote": "Dear Freya, \n\nI just wanted to write and tell you of the amazing impact your invites had on our guests. \n\nEveryone said they have never seen invitations like ours before, and the fact you managed to capture our personalities and incorporate them into the unique concept, had everyone talking. To the extent of the RSVP being photo copied as they wanted to keep the original.\n\nA friend on Facebook who isn't even coming to the wedding asked if I could send her one, just so she could put it on her Mantle piece!! She even sent me her address!!!\n\nSo, thank you again for starting our wedding in the way we mean to carry it on.\n",

      "quote": "I honestly cannot recommend Freya enough. The combination of her amazing creative ability and unique designs, with her adorable personality and prompt communication, meant that the whole process was genuinely really good fun, and most importantly, produced the most beautiful invitations I have ever seen!\n\nAs soon as my now husband and I viewed the Br&NewWeddings website we knew we had found something special that far exceeded the other stationary we had viewed. In addition to the designs, it was the prompt call back and the discussions with Freya that assured us we had found the designer of our wedding invitations. Freya was warm and friendly and immediately seemed to grasp my vision. Within a week we received 3 concepts that had not only perfectly created my vision but also added to and enhanced it. And the caricatures were pure brilliance! Freya captured the facial expression of my husband so well it made me laugh every time I looked at it!\n\nWe had a very tight schedule in which to create the invitations but Freya managed this without difficulty. And originally we had only intended to have invitations designed but due to the wonderful process, beautiful unique designs and compliments from our guests we went back for more! Thank you so so much Freya for your contribution in making our day so special xx\n\nThank you again!!!",
