She went above and beyond and we got so so so many compliments on all the stationery (particularly our pop up invites and bespoke crackers). Thanks for everything Freya.",

Our brief was quite complex and not only was Freya’s first design spot on, but she turned it around in the blink of an eye! We were delighted with the design and we had loads of compliments when we sent them to our friends and family, so clearly they were impressed with them too! Freya also worked around the clock to help us hit some deadlines, nothing was too much trouble. If you haven’t yet chosen your stationery….book to meet with Freya!",

      "quote": "It was an absolute pleasure working with Freya. Her energy and enthusiasm is infectious and her ability to put together ideas really made the products come alive. Freya created our save the dates and our invitation cards, both of which were so good we made sure to order a few spare to keep as mementos. We gave Freya some ideas and themes but to be honest we were clueless on what we really wanted. The ideas and samples we got back though were truly amazing and it wasn't long before we were sending them out in the post. The products were finished to a high quality and professional standard and we could not recommend Freya enough. If you are looking for professionally crafted stationery with a touch of personality and hint of flair, all bespoke and made to your taste, please get in touch with Freya. It will be the best decision you can make.",

      "quote": "\"We don't even know where to start with praising Freya! She is AMAZING!\n\nWe were quite specific with our stationery theme - 'Turkish, Winter, Christmas but not too Christmas and still Wedding' and how Freya managed to pull all of this together, we will never know! From the Save the Dates to the beautiful frame made for my sister to give us a wedding gift to remember our day, and everything in between was beyond beautiful. \n\nAll of the little details in the stationery did not go unnoticed and even on the day we kept getting so many comments from our guests saying how gorgeous it all was and how it tied in so perfectly with the venue and feel of our wedding.\n\nEverything was so beautiful, classy, elegant and festive! Nothing was too much trouble, everything we asked for we got, and got better than we imagined. Not only is Freya amazing at her job, she is fun, friendly and yet professional. Her attitude to your work and business is marvellous. \n\nThis stationery is one of a kind, and everything that is produced is different from the next and different to anything else we have ever seen! THANK YOU!!\"",

To the extent of the RSVP being photo copied as they wanted to keep the original.\n\nA friend on Facebook who isn't even coming to the wedding asked if I could send her one, just so she could put it on her Mantle piece!! She even sent me her address!!!\n\nSo, thank you again for starting our wedding in the way we mean to carry it on.\n",

      "quote": "Sally and I had been looking at wedding stationery for weeks and couldn't believe how expensive it was or how dull it was. We looked at a few bespoke services online but they all seemed way beyond what we wanted to spend. Then Sally saw Freya's work at a wedding show and suggested we give her a call.\n\nFrom the moment we met her we knew Freya was going to do something special for us.\n\nWe had a vague idea of playing with marriage idioms (\"taking the plunge, \"tying the knot\", etc) and within our first meeting Freya had helped us get to a whole bunch of ideas. Within a week we saw the first draft of our invitation \"taking the plunge\" and she happily took all our edits as we constantly changed our minds. Then came the order of service and table names that were all based on \"tying the knot\". Freya sourced knot diagrams which she then reproduced perfectly for 18 table plans. It must have taken her ages!\n\nBut in a final show of great service she came up with the idea of \"popping the question\" for the place names for which she sourced, measured and prepared 150 champagne corks in which to put name tags. The whole stationery set was wonderful and cost not more than much of the off the shelf stuff we'd been looking at. But more than that, Freya's attention to detail, creativity and sheer excitement in doing this for us made it just perfect. We couldn't recommend her more.",

      "quote": "I honestly cannot recommend Freya enough. The combination of her amazing creative ability and unique designs, with her adorable personality and prompt communication, meant that the whole process was genuinely really good fun, and most importantly, produced the most beautiful invitations I have ever seen!\n\nAs soon as my now husband and I viewed the Br&NewWeddings website we knew we had found something special that far exceeded the other stationary we had viewed. In addition to the designs, it was the prompt call back and the discussions with Freya that assured us we had found the designer of our wedding invitations. Freya was warm and friendly and immediately seemed to grasp my vision. Within a week we received 3 concepts that had not only perfectly created my vision but also added to and enhanced it. And the caricatures were pure brilliance! Freya captured the facial expression of my husband so well it made me laugh every time I looked at it!\n\nWe had a very tight schedule in which to create the invitations but Freya managed this without difficulty. And originally we had only intended to have invitations designed but due to the wonderful process, beautiful unique designs and compliments from our guests we went back for more! Thank you so so much Freya for your contribution in making our day so special xx\n\nThank you again!!!",

As soon as we started discussing my ideas she instantly made me feel better, it was not something she had done before but was excited about trying something new and she certainly did not disappoint. Freya managed to create an invitation that was even more perfect than I could of ever hoped for. It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Freya and I would definitely recommend her. In fact I have already had people ask where I got my invites made and I have happily passed on her details.",
