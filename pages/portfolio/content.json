Their enthusiasm and passion made it so easy to take their ideas and run with them.\n\nFrom their hanging-disk save the dates, to their amazing flower garland table plan the stationery acted as an anchor for the rest of their day, not to mention their beautiful Order of the Day booklet.\n\nBeing one of the first suppliers Amy & Leo commissioned we were more than happy to liaise with other suppliers during our development time, working closely with the wedding coordinator at Sopley Mill and their florist to make sure the theme worked seamlessly throughout the day. The florist took inspiration from the gorgeous floral illustration managing to match the colours and design perfectly!\n\nThe attention to detail was striking and the whole day was full of personal and fun details.",

Over an hour later we were chatting like old friends about every detail of the wedding and getting excited looking at invitation samples and mood-boards.\n\nDebra had a strong idea of the theme and style she was after \"Preppy elegance - meets Scotland - meets NYC - meets London!,\" which resulted in the striking navy & white striped stationery, mixed with a Rennie Mackintosh font and gold foiled monogram.\n\nLandmark building silhouettes from all three locations, which have personal importance to Debra & Graham, followed through the stationery as details in the order of service, table names and the table plan.\n\nMini name tags tied with striped navy ribbon had charity pins fixed to them as doubled up as place names, being fixed round the napkins.\n\nAll this was finished off with 'do not disturb' signs for guests and thank you cards.",

I hadn't anticipated that the stationery would be such an important part of the whole wedding but we probably received more comments from guests on that than anything else! Everything from the invitations to the Do Not Disturb signs for hotel doors was stunning! Freya was so lovely to deal with - responsive and friendly and came up with some very original ideas.

There was chat of tractor rides, woodland animals, hay bales, and an OWL delivering the ring down the aisle! AMAZING! \n\nThe result was this spectacular illustration depicting all the animals which could be found in the woodland around the reception venue which was atop a hill at Jo's family home. Jo & Jamie wanted a rustic theme but also something unique and the personal detail in the invitations really delivered this. \n\nInstead of a standard invitation suite we created a little booklet which held all the information required for quests, along with a little RSVP postcard. \n\nTheir table names were each one of the animals from the invitations and it was all finished off with the most beautiful map showing the venues and travel info. \n\nEnjoy!

Therefore we created a wonderful secret garden design which hid cats, crocs, cameras, wine bottles, saucepans (!) ..and all sorts of other wonderful items in the stationery.

Br&newweddings created personal caricatures in the iconic Hedkandi style and developed a club flyer invitation that would inspire guests and set the scene perfectly. Party On!!",

      "blurb": "Karen and Ben came to us with a clear idea of a design they wanted, they had struggled to find someone who could make their vision reality and a printers could not offer the right level of design input for them. Br&newweddings were able to help by detailing and developing their idea into a polished and beautiful design incorporating all the elements that the couple wanted. \n\nThe illustrative black and white design was used to commemorate Karen's late Grandmother 'Ivy,' and the monogram of the couples initials brought the stationery together throughout the lead-up and on the day itself. \n\nWe helped tie everything together from the pocketfold invitations, to the thank you cards and everything in between. The stationery reflected the elegant and sophisticated day Karen and Ben had planned which included top hats, wine pairing and fantastic food with the gorgeous backdrop of Clearwell Castle. \n\nWe think the final effect of the black and cream design was so striking and fitted their smart and sophisticated day perfectly.

They were having a very intimate wedding with only 12 guests and this meant we could really create something exceptional for them. \nTheir wedding was held at Eilean Donan Castle, Scotland and their reception was a Michelin Star meal at Kinloch Lodge on the Isle of Skye. \n\nWe were thrilled when they decided to go ahead with our porcelain invitation concepts and the end result was simply spectacular. Porcelain coaster-style invitations were designed and hand crafted by DJ Ceramics in Wiltshire, and bespoke ash display boxes by the very talented Trufitt Furniture were made to order especially so they fitted perfectly.\n\nThe invitations featured an indented thistle design to the front which also followed throughout the menus for their day and bespoke stickers for detailing, and guest information applied with ceramic transfer on the reverse - a perfect keepsake as well as an invitation.\n\nFor the wedding breakfast Jennifer had individually sourced unique vintage teacups as favours for each of her guests, each from the year in which they were born.  We worked with Jennifer to create unique matching teapot place names which were detailed on stands featuring a lucky penny in the base as a weight.\n\nThe uniqueness of this wedding is simply beautiful and we were all thrilled with the final result.",

Caroline is from Paris and Adrian from London and having got engaged at the top of The Shard they really wanted their stationery and wedding to reflect their story. The colours were picked from the 'firecracker' bridesmaid dresses and the grooms mens navy suits. All stationery had to be in dual language which tested our GCSE years but in the end we totally cracked it (with a bit of help!). \n\nThe stylised illustrations of landmarks in both London and Paris made the invitation so unique and these translated through to the day itself featuring a bespoke illustration of Ealing Abbey and featuring on various other elements tying the whole day together perfectly. \n\nFrench Macaron (the best we have ever tasted!) with beautiful individually named bands doubled as place names and the table names were styled as both London and Parisian street signs. Br&newweddings created all their stationery right down to menus per table and \"merci / thankyou\" boards that the couple could hold and photograph on their big day to use for their thank you cards. \n\nEt Voila!

They had fallen in love with our gorgeous hand illustrated designs so we set about creating a bright and colourful stationery suite based on the chosen florals for their day. Sunflowers and berries mixed with the striking architectural curls of New Zealand ferns which picked out Ella's mothers ancestry. The result, along with the dramatic grey and yellow invitation card and bespoke travel maps, were stunning and resulted in a whole set of stationery following through their day from the table plan to place name tags tied around napkins. Their gift list was the fabulous SmileTrain charity and their just giving page has raised over Â£3000 for the cause. Well done guys and congratulations! ",
