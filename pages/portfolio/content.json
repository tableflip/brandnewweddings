Their enthusiasm and passion made it so easy to take their ideas and run with them.\n\nFrom their hanging-disk save the dates, to their amazing flower garland table plan the stationery acted as an anchor for the rest of their day, not to mention their beautiful Order of the Day booklet.\n\nBeing one of the first suppliers Amy & Leo commissioned we were more than happy to liaise with other suppliers during our development time, working closely with the wedding coordinator at Sopley Mill and their florist to make sure the theme worked seamlessly throughout the day. The florist took inspiration from the gorgeous floral illustration managing to match the colours and design perfectly!\n\nThe attention to detail was striking and the whole day was full of personal and fun details.",

Over an hour later we were chatting like old friends about every detail of the wedding and getting excited looking at invitation samples and mood-boards.\n\nDebra had a strong idea of the theme and style she was after \"Preppy elegance - meets Scotland - meets NYC - meets London!,\" which resulted in the striking navy & white striped stationery, mixed with a Rennie Mackintosh font and foiled initial monogram.\n\nLandmark building silhouettes from all three locations, which have personal importance to Debra & Graham, followed through the stationery as details in the order of service, table names and the table plan.\n\nMini name tags tied with striped navy ribbon had charity pins fixed to them as doubled up as place names, being fixed round the napkins.\n\nAll this was finished off with 'do not disturb' signs for guests and thank you cards.",
      "quote": "Freya got our style straight away and created beautiful stationery which tied everything together perfectly. I hadn't anticipated that the stationery would be such an important part of the whole wedding but we probably received more comments from guests on that than anything else! Everything from the invitations to the Do Not Disturb signs for hotel doors was stunning! Freya was so lovely to deal with - responsive and friendly and came up with some very original ideas. She also went above and beyond hand delivering our on the day stationery on a Sunday! Can't recommend Br&newweddings highly enough!",

We could tell from their style that their day was going to be something special, and we clocked onto their ideas and theme straight away. \n\nA sage green theme to match the bridesmaids and a delicate and elegant leaf pattern which was taken from a dress Charlotte had fallen in love with set the theme, and when accompanied by bespoke illustrations of the venue and chapel the design came to life. \n\nA highlight of the process was when Charlotte and Gerard asked me to create bespoke individually names bands for their coke-bottle favours-cum-place names.. and after asking about the connection we heard the story of how the couple had met on a train when Gerard spied Charlotte struggling to open her bottle of Coke. He offered to help, the rest is history. ",

Michaela being a wedding planner herself wanted something totally unique and was thrilled with the final result.\n\nEvery year Michaela & Ollie travel to Turkey and so wanted the turkish eye to be incorporated somewhere without being too overpowering; the result was a stunning floral illustration working with the winter blooms of Michaela's flowers, a traditional turkish ceramic pattern, and the cool and sophisticated winter wedding colours of whites and light blues.\n\nWe rolled the design out across the whole day from the Save the Dates, Invitations and Evening Invitations,  Table Plan & Names, Place Names, Order of Service and Day... and a little framed print from Michaela's Bridesmaid to her sister as a surprise wedding present! \n\nThe turkish eye favours finished the place names perfectly and the whole room oozed style, beauty and sophistication!\nCan we do it all again please!?",

All of the little details did not go unnoticed and even on the day we kept getting so many comments from our guests saying how gorgeous it all was and how it tied in so perfectly with the venue and feel of our wedding. \n\nNothing was too much trouble, everything we asked for we got, and got better than we imagined. Not only is Freya amazing at her job, she is fun, friendly and yet professional. Her attitude to your work and business is marvellous.\n\nThis stationary is one of a kind, and everything that is produced is different from the next and different to anything else we have ever seen!

Jo & Jamie wanted a rustic theme but also something unique and the personal detail in the invitations really delivered this. \n\nInstead of a standard invitation suite we created a little booklet which held all the information required for quests, along with a little RSVP postcard. \n\nTheir table names were each one of the animals from the invitations and it was all finished off with the most beautiful map showing the venues and travel info. \n\nEnjoy!
