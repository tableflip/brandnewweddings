Their enthusiasm and passion made it so easy to take their ideas and run with them.\n\nFrom their hanging-disk save the dates, to their amazing flower garland table plan the stationery acted as an anchor for the rest of their day, not to mention their beautiful Order of the Day booklet.\n\nBeing one of the first suppliers Amy & Leo commissioned we were more than happy to liaise with other suppliers during our development time, working closely with the wedding coordinator at Sopley Mill and their florist to make sure the theme worked seamlessly throughout the day. The florist took inspiration from the gorgeous floral illustration managing to match the colours and design perfectly!\n\nThe attention to detail was striking and the whole day was full of personal and fun details.",

Over an hour later we were chatting like old friends about every detail of the wedding and getting excited looking at invitation samples and mood-boards.\n\nDebra had a strong idea of the theme and style she was after \"Preppy elegance - meets Scotland - meets NYC - meets London!,\" which resulted in the striking navy & white striped stationery, mixed with a Rennie Mackintosh font and foiled initial monogram.\n\nLandmark building silhouettes from all three locations, which have personal importance to Debra & Graham, followed through the stationery as details in the order of service, table names and the table plan.\n\nMini name tags tied with striped navy ribbon had charity pins fixed to them as doubled up as place names, being fixed round the napkins.\n\nAll this was finished off with 'do not disturb' signs for guests and thank you cards.",

I hadn't anticipated that the stationery would be such an important part of the whole wedding but we probably received more comments from guests on that than anything else!

There was chat of tractor rides, woodland animals, hay bales, and an OWL delivering the ring down the aisle! AMAZING! \n\nThe result was this spectacular illustration depicting all the animals which could be found in the woodland around the reception venue which was atop a hill at Jo's family home. Jo & Jamie wanted a rustic theme but also something unique and the personal detail in the invitations really delivered this. \n\nInstead of a standard invitation suite we created a little booklet which held all the information required for quests, along with a little RSVP postcard. \n\nTheir table names were each one of the animals from the invitations and it was all finished off with the most beautiful map showing the venues and travel info. \n\nEnjoy!

All with their own branded cotton bag and their invitations sat on top perfectly. \n\nThe style of the day worked perfectly through the stationery suite from quirky on the wonk escort cards to their pick and mix table cards (yes guests picked which table to sit at from a lucky dip....

Therefore we created a wonderful secret garden design which hid cats, crocs, cameras, wine bottles, saucepans (!) ..and all sorts of other wonderful items in the stationery. The theme developed beautifully across the day incorporating herbs into the on-the-day stationery and illustrating bespoke recipes for each one on the back of each table name. The set was completed by a gorgeous fan order of service, which came into play on their sunny summers day.",

Porcelain coaster-style invitations were designed and hand crafted by DJ Ceramics in Wiltshire, and bespoke ash display boxes by the very talented Trufitt Furniture were made to order especially so they fitted perfectly.\n\nThe invitations featured an indented thistle design to the front which also followed throughout the menus for their day and bespoke stickers for detailing, and guest information applied with ceramic transfer on the reverse - a perfect keepsake as well as an invitation.\n\nFor the wedding breakfast Jennifer had individually sourced unique vintage teacups as favours for each of her guests, each from the year in which they were born.  We worked with Jennifer to create unique matching teapot place names which were detailed on stands featuring a lucky penny in the base as a weight.\n\nThe uniqueness of this wedding is simply beautiful and we were all thrilled with the final result.",

All stationery had to be in dual language which tested our GCSE years but in the end we totally cracked it (with a bit of help!). \n\nThe stylised illustrations of landmarks in both London and Paris made the invitation so unique and these translated through to the day itself featuring a bespoke illustration of Ealing Abbey and featuring on various other elements tying the whole day together perfectly. \n\nFrench Macaron (the best we have ever tasted!) with beautiful individually named bands doubled as place names and the table names were styled as both London and Parisian street signs. Br&newweddings created all their stationery right down to menus per table and \"merci / thankyou\" boards that the couple could hold and photograph on their big day to use for their thank you cards. \n\nEt Voila!

The stationery reflected the elegant and sophisticated day Karen and Ben had planned which included top hats, wine pairing and fantastic food with the gorgeous backdrop of Clearwell Castle. \n\nWe think the final effect of the black and cream design was so striking and fitted their smart and sophisticated day perfectly.
