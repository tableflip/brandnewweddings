      "blurb": "Rather a special one this, being for none other than our very own designer Freya and her fiancé Steve. The date being bonfire night meant that there was a fantastic starting point for their style; glitz, glamour and sparkle... and the letterpress save the date with mini sparklers and bespoke 'remember remember' poem set the scene perfectly. \n\nThe overall concept came to life using an illustration style they had fallen in love with whilst on holiday in Vienna a few years previously, incorporating ferns, orchids and chillies in the most gorgeous organic pattern bringing in their love (and reputation) for growing chillies into the stationery. \n\nGold foiling and unique icons and illustrations were incorporated effortlessly into the suite, none better than with the menu insert which depicted mini illustrations of each Pie & Pud option guests could choose. \n\nA fold out origami information booklet tied with ribbon was one of the highlights of the invitation and all parts were  finished off in a beautiful semi-transparent wrapper and set into bespoke foiled boxes. \n\nRenowned for their love of a game or competition Freya & Steve's day was full of fun and laughter. Their ceremony was fantastic, with each guest receiving a party horn or blower to make as much noise as possible whilst their master of ceremonies barked orders through a personalised megaphone! The order of service included individual caricatures of the bridal party so guests could say hello during reception drinks and a unique 'hammer a nail in the log' game reminiscent of fairground games kept guests busy between the ceremony and evening festivities. \n\nBespoke and personalised playing cards on the dinner tables along with a childhood favourite game kept guests busy and broke the ice whilst stunning paper leaf table centres, fairy lit Maple Tree’s and macramé hanging baskets made by the Mother of the Bride finished the venue decor perfectly. \n\nYou can see more of the details from their day on our Instagram or Facebook pages, just give us a follow. \n  ",
      "quote": "Br&newweddings were fantastic, they managed to take the venue, ideas and style we envisaged and turn the stationery into our very own work of art which featured throughout the day... of course we are bias but we think the end result speaks for itself. \n\nWe’ve had so many comments on the save the dates, invitations and on-the-day stationery we cant keep count. It helped make our day so special and personal, we wouldn't have done it any differently.  \n\nObviously we recommend Br&newweddings 110% and are thrilled we got to work with them on our own stationery.",

      "blurb": "I met Vicky & Si one weekend when they flew in from Geneva to see our beautiful samples. Having fallen in love with a design we had created a year previously there was little more to do than get in touch with Charlotte & Gerard and ask whether they would mind some of their details being used again. Being such a generous bride of course Charlotte didn't mind and we set about creating a bespoke design for V&S using a wallpaper'esq style pattern based on the Micocoulier leaves that grow on the tree's lining the drive at Simon's parents home in France. The whole suite was printed on gorgeous soft feel paper, double bonded for a fabulous heavy quality and finished off with the most beautiful rose gold foiling. We used textures to add a luxurious feel with a translucent cover to the little info booklet and held together with a matching rose gold bulldog clip and a stunning botanical illustration for the envelope liners.\nTheir on the day stationery followed suit and really helped the elegant and romantic sage colour scheme run through the whole day.\n",

From the invitation suite to the flowers, to THAT dress, to the Green & Blacks individually wrapped chocolate bar favours and matching postage stamps we had an absolute ball working with this happy couple. \n\nWe worked with Katie & Scot over the space of 8 months creating a complete set of stationery for their flower filled day at Great Fosters, Surrey. The photographic background eluded to the opulent and romantic vibe of the day itself and everything from rsvp's, to thank you cards, and everything in between followed suit. \n\nKatie was a joy to work with and kept us up to date with the antics of the gorgeous \"Jeff the Pug\" (...yes he has his own Instagram account) as we shared development images with her along the way. Never have we been so excited to receive photo messages! \n\nThe day itself was perfectly arranged with individually named place setting cards with menu choices and an order of the speeches on the reverse, finished of with the mini chocolate bar favours sealed with bespoke stickers, and surrounded by the most gorgeous floral displays imaginable by Rebecca at Laura Kuy flowers.\n\nWe wish Katie & Scot the hugest happiness in their married life & will certainly be in touch for more Jeff the Pug updates!  \n\n**Featured on \"Style and the Bride\" (link in suppliers section below)**\nOn the day photography courtesy of Hayley Bray)\n\n ",
      "quote": "As soon as I met Freya I knew she would be the one to design our wedding stationery. From start to finish Freya was not only professional and easy to work with but she was fun and full of ideas and helpful little tips. She even managed to find some limited edition stamps that colour matched our invitations perfectly and most of our guests commented on how professional that was! I felt we bounced our ideas off each other and the stationery came out better than I could have imagined. Freya spent hours unwrapping and re-wrapping our chocolate bar favours with a hand made sleeve and also designed our thank you cards which carry on the theme. I would not hesitate to recommend Freya to anyone looking for unique and bespoke stationery that will stand out and I wish Freya all the success in the future with this fantastic business.",

Jessica & Christian ooze sophistication and when they spoke of their ideas around their Lake Como wedding it was impossible not to fall in love and get swept up in the dream! \n\nThey had seen a map style invitation they loved and wanted something similar for their weekend away so our designer Freya created a gorgeous and unique half hand-drawn, half digitally created map of Lake Como featuring bespoke illustrations of all the locations and venues which were available for the wedding. She also created little bespoke icons for the information pages on the reverse and details for the belly band and menus. All printed on luxurious GFSmith Card with matching envelopes, labels and stickers. \n\nThe final result was so fabulous, finished with a thermo plaque which added detail and texture to the design and pretty luxury bakers twine to complete the place name tags it is the kind of stationery you simply want to stroke it felt so silky and tactile!\n\nWhen the photos came back from the talented Bottega 53 we could see just how their day had come together and how the classic but well-detailed stationery had finished it off to a tee. \n\nHuge congratulations to the new Mr & Mrs Tschirdewahn, it was a complete pleasure to work with you and be involved in your stunning day. \n\n",

It sounds like an age but it meant we could totally get involved in the whole day and make sure the stationery was consistent and held the whole thing together from the save the dates all the way through to thank you cards. The brief was tropical, fun, slightly rustic and colourful so alot of research was needed to get the designs spot on! \n\nThe whole suite was matched to the turquoise Pantone wedding & Dessy bridesmaids dress swatch and we managed to match ribbon, graphics and designs to these perfectly. They featured little caricatures of the bride and groom and hand illustrated flowers which reflected the bouquets and displays on the day itself. \n\nThere were so many highlights, Frankfurter their GORGEOUS sausage dog being the ring bearer in his bespoke bowtie and matching lead, the sausage dog Grey Goose vodka luge, the amazing flowers which were designed to match our illustrations perfectly, the bouncy castle... where do we stop! \n\nOne of our favourite parts was seeing all their photos popping up online and nearly ALL of them featuring our stationery. The attention to detail had not gone unnoticed. The Order of Service Fan was a firm favourite with bespoke caricatures of the entire bridal party on one side and the service on the other.. along with the details throughout the evening, little messages on toilet luxuries, flipflop baskets, smores jars... everything had been thought about and it all looked stunning on the day. \n\nHuge congratulations to Mr & Mrs Stebbings, we wish you the very best in your married life together. \n \n",

Jo & Jamie wanted a rustic theme but also something unique and the personal detail in the invitations really delivered this. \n\nInstead of a standard invitation suite we created a little booklet which held all the information required for quests, along with a little RSVP postcard. \n\nTheir table names were each one of the animals from the invitations and it was all finished off with the most beautiful map showing the venues and travel info. \n\nEnjoy!

We could tell from their style that their day was going to be something special, and we clocked onto their ideas and theme straight away. \n\nA sage green theme to match the bridesmaids and a delicate and elegant leaf pattern which was taken from a dress Charlotte had fallen in love with set the theme, and when accompanied by bespoke illustrations of the venue and chapel the design came to life. \n\nA highlight of the process was when Charlotte and Gerard asked me to create bespoke individually names bands for their coke-bottle favours-cum-place names.. and after asking about the connection we heard the story of how the couple had met on a train when Gerard spied Charlotte struggling to open her bottle of Coke. He offered to help, the rest is history. ",

Br&newweddings were able to help by detailing and developing their idea into a polished and beautiful design incorporating all the elements that the couple wanted. \n\nThe illustrative black and white design was used to commemorate Karen's late Grandmother 'Ivy,' and the monogram of the couples initials brought the stationery together throughout the lead-up and on the day itself. \n\nWe helped tie everything together from the pocketfold invitations, to the thank you cards and everything in between. The stationery reflected the elegant and sophisticated day Karen and Ben had planned which included top hats, wine pairing and fantastic food with the gorgeous backdrop of Clearwell Castle. \n\nWe think the final effect of the black and cream design was so striking and fitted their smart and sophisticated day perfectly.

They were having a very intimate wedding with only 12 guests and this meant we could really create something exceptional for them. \nTheir wedding was held at Eilean Donan Castle, Scotland and their reception was a Michelin Star meal at Kinloch Lodge on the Isle of Skye. \n\nWe were thrilled when they decided to go ahead with our porcelain invitation concepts and the end result was simply spectacular. Porcelain coaster-style invitations were designed and hand crafted by DJ Ceramics in Wiltshire, and bespoke ash display boxes by the very talented Trufitt Furniture were made to order especially so they fitted perfectly.\n\nThe invitations featured an indented thistle design to the front which also followed throughout the menus for their day and bespoke stickers for detailing, and guest information applied with ceramic transfer on the reverse - a perfect keepsake as well as an invitation.\n\nFor the wedding breakfast Jennifer had individually sourced unique vintage teacups as favours for each of her guests, each from the year in which they were born.  We worked with Jennifer to create unique matching teapot place names which were detailed on stands featuring a lucky penny in the base as a weight.\n\nThe uniqueness of this wedding is simply beautiful and we were all thrilled with the final result.",

All stationery had to be in dual language which tested our GCSE years but in the end we totally cracked it (with a bit of help!). \n\nThe stylised illustrations of landmarks in both London and Paris made the invitation so unique and these translated through to the day itself featuring a bespoke illustration of Ealing Abbey and featuring on various other elements tying the whole day together perfectly. \n\nFrench Macaron (the best we have ever tasted!) with beautiful individually named bands doubled as place names and the table names were styled as both London and Parisian street signs. Br&newweddings created all their stationery right down to menus per table and \"merci / thankyou\" boards that the couple could hold and photograph on their big day to use for their thank you cards. \n\nEt Voila!

The table plan featured over 100 handcut corks ( you guessed it - Popping the Question)  and fitted with little name cards and stickers on the base telling the guests which table they were on. The order of service finished off the collection and lastly.. THE CAKE!

A little folded pocket on the reverse held guest specific inserts including details for the morning after and accommodation which had been pre-booked. All this was contained with a beautiful rich burgundy ribbon and packaged in a stunning claret envelope with gold twist liner. The liner although using an expensive choice of paper elevated the design without creating huge cost and pulled the elegance and sophistication of the day together. \n\nSimply stunning.",
